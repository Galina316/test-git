“Green divided by white rapids.”

“The shivering soul-reaching shock of the water. The beverage of the animals.”

“Drowning not in water but in a sense of belonging.”

“The water’s writing engraves the rocks like the graphite from my pencil engraves this paper.”

“It says meditate to throw away your anger.”


 Now You Will Feel

     Now You Will Feel
“I said I didn’t love you,
I said I didn’t want you,
but continued to act normal,
to extend common courtesies,
even–
in moments of weakness–
a certain kindness.

“The treatment failed.
Your sickness lingers.
Now you must feel the cold truth of my not loving you.”
